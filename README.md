# gpt-line-realtime-bridge

This repository contains the Realtime Bridge service for the GPT-Line system.

It is part of the full GPT-Line multi-service architecture and should be developed according to the locked service specification in `docs/spec.md`.

The master coordination repository for the whole system is:

https://github.com/yossef6548/gpt-line

That master repo contains:
- the full system architecture
- cross-service contracts
- dependency graphs
- development order
- the authoritative coordination documents for all services

This repository is responsible only for the Realtime Bridge service and should not redefine cross-service contracts on its own.
